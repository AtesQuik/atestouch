# atestouch

# Overview
A fully documented, blazingly fast, easy to use and work in progress touch controls library for all GameMaker games!

# Features (currently)
- Very easily integrable, just by applying the .yymps to your GameMaker project.
- Customization, thanks to the included edit mode.
- Very fast, it works as well as virtual keys although it doesn't use them.

# Plans (for future releases)
- ~~V1: Function to create touch elements, editing mode to modify the buttons, saving and loading.~~ (DONE)
- V2: [UMT](https://github.com/UnderminersTeam/UndertaleModTool) script for atestouch, better edit mode, dynamic D-PAD creation, customization menu. (WIP)
- V3: New touch mode from [Bad Time Simulator](https://jcw87.github.io/c2-sans-fight/) mobile version, custom sprite loading. (PLANNED)
- V4: Custom mobile keyboard, preset saving/loading. (PLANNED)

# Documentation
- You can refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/AtesQuik/atestouch/wiki) once its done.

# LICENSE
- atestouch is licensed under the MIT License. See the LICENSE file for more information.
- TLDR; You're free to use this as long as proper credit is given, if the ports are made without the consent of the author of the game or something controversial, I have a right to ask you to remove **atestouch** content from your project.
- The sprites used in this project were made by my sister, huge thanks to her :> (You can use them with proper credit.)
